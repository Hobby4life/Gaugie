------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have made several gauge widgets in the past, that all have their own functions and purpose.

This time I wanted a renewed version of the built in Horus gauge widget.

The looks of the built in widget is so outdated, and the readability of the gauge, nehhh I dont like it. not clear to me.

So I decided to make my own again.

The function is the same, only the color grading is much better visible.

The gauge is a real gauge, with a frame arround it, and a good background for good contrast readabilty.

An extra option is you can set “LipoGauge” the gauge will now represents itself as in green color changing gauge from 100% to 30% and then goes solid red from 30% to 0%.

The widget automaticly resises to all widget layout sizes. including the topbar widget area.
